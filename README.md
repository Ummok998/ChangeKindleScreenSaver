# ChangeKindleScreenSaver
Allows you to change the stock screensaver on a jailbroken Kindle.

**Note:** This modifies files. I am not responsible if this bricks your Kindle. This has been tested on 5.18.1. 

**Note 2:** "createtwentyfiles.py" takes a PNG named "screensaver.png" in the same folder and duplicates that twenty times. This simplifies the second step.

**Note 3:** Your Kindle will need to have ads disabled. Having the book cover appear will also overwrite this.

# Instructions
1. On your computer, create or find a 1272x1696 PNG.
2. Duplicate this PNG 20 times. Name each one bg_ss**.png, where ** is a number from 00 to 19.
3. On your Kindle, create a folder named "screensaver".
4. Put "changeScreenSavers.sh" in the "documents" folder.
5. Take the 20 PNGs you made earlier, and place them in the "screensaver" folder.
6. Run the "Change Screensaver" scriptlet.
7. Enjoy.

Again, this is if you really hate KOReader and can't stand using it. If you can, please just use that.
